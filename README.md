# ypid-keys

Better alternative to https://github.com/ypid.keys.

If you want to give me access to a server or part of your infrastructure for
some reason, you can use the SSH public key in this repo. This is the better
choice than using the SSH key I use to authenticate against GitHub for example.
As a Qubes OS user, I maintain strict isolation so my development environment
has no access to my admin environment.

This repo is signed by my OpenPGP master key.
